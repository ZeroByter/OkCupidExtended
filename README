## Automatic updates?

No, not yet. If this project gets serious enough, I might make it into it's very own Chrome extension, but no promises so far.

## Usage

- Click on the big centered headers to expand or collapse sections.
- Click on location buttons to turn them red, which indicates they will be automatically skipped if you come across a user from that location (use this to auto-skip users from far away, when you really only want to see users from nearby)
- Search by id, name, or location past seen users (also saved across sessions!)
- Seen users are simply your recently seen users
